# ElectionAnalysis - Module 3 U of A Bootcamp
Overview of Election Audit
The Colorado Board of Elections has asked for a vote count report to help certify election
results in the congressional race in Precinct 1. The team was asked to report the total number of
votes cast, total of votes for each candidate, percentages for each candidate, and the winner based
on the popular vote. There will be three types of votes to be counted, mail-in ballots, punch
cards, and direct reporting electronic (DRE). Excel would be the default software for this task,
but the Colorado Board of Elections would like an automated way to complete the count, which
is why Python will be used.

# Election-Audit Results
After completing the audit of voters, the Colorado Board of Elections and the team can
answer the questions that will educate the voters on their choices for the congressional race.

★ How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

county in the precinct.

○ Jefferson county cast a total of 38,855 votes, weighted at 10.5% of the total
votes.

# Election-Audit Summary
The script used for this process does simplify the process of counting and certifying
elections, however it was a lengthy process that included hours of training personnel that asked
to become familiar with the codes. For future applications, the simplest use would be in similar
election circumstances with minor adjustments to the lists containing counties and candidates,
this would generate the same data types. If the election committee wishes for more details, this
script could also be modified to compute other trends of data, such as which geographical areas
voted for which candidates, and possibly even compile survey data about voter thoughts.
